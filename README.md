# LeetCode

Well, I'm a bit late to the party but better late than never. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) seems to be the new place
to be and because algorithms have always been my weak spot, it is about time to do something about that. My plan is to 
try to solve a problem every few days and share it in this repo with whoever is interested in my solution. Might not
always work, because of my kids and stuff, but I want to give it a try.

Without further ado, lets get into it.
